MS22903242_MLAssignment0 This report delves into addressing a critical challenge faced by banks, which is predicting whether a particular customer will initiate a term deposit. A public dataset hosted by UCI Machine Learning Repository which contains real-world data from a Portuguese banking institution has been selected for this task. This dataset is analysed, and predictive models have been developed using supervised learning algorithms. The predictions will assist the bank to identify potential clients who would likely subscribe to the bankâ€™s term deposit. Link to Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing
